The intent of Value Space is to make a set of tools accessible to the retail investor deciding which funds and stocks to purchase or the “quant” with a background in quantitative methods and data science who is interested in learning corporate finance and value investing.   The initial focus is on firm valuation, performance attribution and factor modeling. We also hope that it will become a forum to discuss new ideas in finance. 

At present, Value Space has three components: A Blog, The Gym, and An Exercise Sequence. 



### The Blog

The Blog is what you are currently reading. 

The blog posts are organized into categories. Methodology posts are explanations of how Value Space works. General Theory posts are my musings on topics that are not specific to the Value Space framework. Case Studies include posts that present a view on a specific firm or set of firms utilizing the Value Space framework. State of the World posts present useful information that is updated as required regarding the state of the world (e.g., example time series of various interest rate benchmarks). Model Management posts include posts that describe updates to the data that underlies the framework, posts that describe enhancements to the methodology, and posts that document efforts to verify and validate the framework.
The Summary page provides an overview to the current approach to investing that Value Space is designed to support and references to the methodological details.

### The Gym

The Gym is a place where many valuation exercises (or analyses) can be conducted (see Page The Gym)

### An Exercise Sequence 

An Exercises Sequence is a specific sequence of exercises that tell a narrative regarding how the market values a specific company (see Page An Exercise Sequence).  

Both the Gym and the Exercise sequence are pre-populated with current data on a sample of 432 non-financial firms, 391 of which are in the S&P 500.
