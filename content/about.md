### Good investments start with good valuations and good things come from good investments! And vice-versa!


I am starting a blog that focuses on the issue of corporate valuations. While the framework applys to all non-financial corporations, I am starting with what I can see---where I can see financial statements and prices.  My source of financial statements is the Edgar so my focus is on firms that have to file their statements with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commision. I also have access to equity research available to a retail investor.


I have yet to see equity research that says that a stock is mis-priced by an order of magnitude or larger. I will not say something is mispriced either, but I will draw attention to cases where the current valuation seems very expensive or very cheap and ponder what the market sees that I am missing.
