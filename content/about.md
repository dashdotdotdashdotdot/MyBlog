## Prologue:

Q: Why did those movies flop?

Ans: They weren't funny.

Q: Why were those movies so successful?

Ans: They were funny. The difference is for the first set of movies we went directly to filming after writing, whereas for the second set we spent the summer working out the jokes on vaudeville and then filmed.

### Trade Secrets?

I am an admirer of the legendary photographer Ansel Adams who said: "I have no secrets of craft, I answer as best I can inquiries on equipment, methods, and relevant situations. I have also used the detailed captions of my technical books as a means of teaching by example and these have apparently been one of the books most appealing aspects." It is this standard that I aspire to in this context (within reason).

### Powered by a Dashboard

The blog is powered by a shiny dashboard that analyzes over 400 firms including the non-financial firms in the S&P 500.  It allows the user to analyze the current valuation of a firm from the perspective of a Discounted Cash Flow calculation. The dashboard runs on a _server in the cloud_ hosted by the company Posit (formerly rStudio).  The posts in this blog take advantage of the code base behind the dashboard. If you click on the screen shot below it will launch.  It can take a minute to load.  It may say "please wait" during this interval.
