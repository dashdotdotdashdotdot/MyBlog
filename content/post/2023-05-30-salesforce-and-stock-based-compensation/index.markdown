Salesforce is a company that uses subtantial amounts of stock based compensation (SBC).  Consequently, if net income computing using GAAP accounting it is much lower than if net income is computed using non-GAAP accounting.  The P/E ratio for Salesforce is very sensitive to whether it is computed using GAAP accounting versus non-GAAP accounting. This note argues that the  current valuation of Salesforce is expensive if one treats SBC as an expense, which is correct.
