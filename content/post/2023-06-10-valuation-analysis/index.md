The notebook is a first pass at a generic report that does a valuation analysis of any firm (for now it is set to Corning Inc, (GLW)).  It assesses whether or not the valuation is expensive versus cheap and what type of valuation it is.  It concludes either "that a value investor would consider investing in it", or "a value investor would probably not invest in it." It provides evidence to support this statement.

This link takes you to what is called a "shiny notebook".  It uses interactive graphics, and the link is hosted by the company Posit (formerly Rstudio).  It may take a few moments to load.  The reason for this is it is deploying a virtual server for you to interact with.   The scatter plots have dynamic axes, and you can hover over points to see the ticker of the firm that corresponds to the point.
