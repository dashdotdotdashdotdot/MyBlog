The post provides an example of the "Single Name Report" 
The notebook is a first pass at a generic report that does a valuation analysis of any firm (for now it is set to Corning Inc, (GLW)).  It assesses whether or not the valuation is expensive versus cheap and what type of valuation it is.  It concludes either "that a value investor would consider investing in it", or "a value investor would probably not invest in it." It provides evidence to support this statement.

If you go to the Single Name Report link at the bottom you can generate another version of this report for the selected ticker.
