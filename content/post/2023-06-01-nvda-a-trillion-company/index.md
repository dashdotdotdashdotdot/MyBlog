Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) recently achieved a market capitalization of \$1T on May 30th 2023 when the
stock price spiked above \$400. The enterprise value of NVDA crossed \$1T as well1. As this implies a P/E
ratio on the order of 200, such a valuation implies that the market has great expectations for NVDA.
How great are the expectations for company given a $1T valuation? How can we think about them?

This note demonstartes that a $1T valuation of Nvidai implies a 7.55\% rate of return for an investor if NVDA is as successful over the next 15 years as Apple has been over the past 15 years.  Investor that have held Apple over the past 15 years have been reward with returns of about 25\%.
