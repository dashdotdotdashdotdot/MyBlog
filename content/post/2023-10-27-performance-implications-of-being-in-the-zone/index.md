We have developed a methodology to calculate trajectories of key financial statement line items that imply a trajectory of cash flows whose discounted value is equal to the current value of the company using a specific weighted average cost of capital (WACC). For the WACC we use 400bps plus the 10 year treasury as of the time that the portfolios are being formed.

This approach allows one to identify companies that are outside the *value zone*. The *value zone* is calibrated such that *out of zone* firms are very unlikely to be purchased by Berkshire Hathaway. Firms that are “out of zone” are firms that do not have a history of positive operating margins or their current valuations rely on strong assumptions regarding operating margin expansions or revenue growth or both. Further, firms can be *out of zone* if their current valuation imply the market expects revenue to decline significantly or margins to contract significanty or both. As the approach is rule-based, we can apply it to all the firms listed in the NSYE, AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges going from 1964 to 2022 with financial statement information.

Reasonable questions to ask are: over a long time period, do *out of zone* stocks underperform the market? Are the differences robust over different time periods? different firm sizes? What about firms that are *in the zone*? What about a long/short strategy? Where do such performance differentials come from? Do these portfolio’s load on factors and thereby explain the differences? which ones? We will show that holding a portfolio of firms that are *In Zone* out performs holding the market and conversely a portfolio that holds a portfolio of firms that are *out of zone* under performs the market.

In this post, we start with the universe of firms that Famma and French use to construct their market factor going back to 1964 (There are over 30,000 firms in the sample.), but we exclude financial firms. We will construct 12 portfolios. In June of each year, we will first assign firms into one of three groups: small, medium and big based on their market capitalization. The cutoffs are chosen such that each group has an equal number of firms in each year. Second, each firm is assigned to a group: *In Zone* and *Out of Zone*. *In Zone* is defined as having a margin attribution in the range of {−2.51, 6.21} and growth attribution in the range of from {−0.4,5.71} as well as having positive operating profit in two out of the past five years (See my Post “Validaiton of the Value Zone (Q3 2023 Update)). We compute value weighted returns for 12 portfolios: {Small, Medium, Big} `\(\times\)` { *In Zone*, *Market*, *Out of Zone*, *Long Short*}, where”In the Zone” is going long all the firms in the value zone in the relevant size group, *The Market* is going long all the names in the relevant size group, *Out of Zone*” is going long tfirms that are *Out of Zone*” and *Long Short* is a self-financing portfolio that is long all the names in Value Zone and short all the names that are *Out of Zone* in the relevant size groups.

The three figures below present the growth of Market Cap of each of the three size groups for the market as a whole and *In Zone* firms (in Blue and by construction is always less than the Market Cap of the *Market* portfolio). At the end of 20222, the big group had about \$33T in total Market Cap, with *In Zone* representing about \$25T. The difference of \$8T represents the Market Cap of *Out of Zone* firms. The Market Cap of the other two size groups is much smaller (about \$1T for the medium group and \$100B for the small group). This difference reflects that even though they each group has the same number of firms in each year, the big firms are much bigger than the medium sized groups which are much bigger than the small size groups.

The relative size gap between Value Zone and the Market as a Whole is time varrying. For all three groups, there is less difference befor 1980 or so. For the large group, the differences is larget in recent years and around towards the end of 2000 – the end of the ‘dot.com bubble’. Following the financial crisis, the gap was minimal. Similar patterns are observed for the Medium Sized and the small portfolios, bu the GAP is more stable.

When we aggregate across size groups we a simple average of the portfolios for each group, after sized the exposures in each portfolio. We will also look at three different time periods: The whole time period, the last twenty years and the period covered by the paper “Buffett’s Alpha.”

We first look at the performance across the four groups over the whole time period and over all size groups. We note that simply buying all the firms and equally weighting the three size groups produces strong results – Excess Returns of 9.4% and a Sharpe Ratio of 0..511. This strong performance reflects that over the past 58 years, the small firms have outperformed large firms after controlling for systematic risk (the CAPM Beta is 1.078 and the Alpha is 2.053). Buying firm that are *In Zone* over-performs the market portfolio by 94bps of excess returns, and higher lower Sharpe ratios, information ratios and alpha. Conversely, buying stocks that are Out of Zone\_ under performs the market by 206bps of excess returns, and lower Sharpe ratios, information ratios and alpha. In fact, the information ratio and the alpha are negative. The performance of the long-short portfolio is relatively poor – an excess return of 2.995% and a Sharpe ratio of 32.3. This poor performance is the result of shorting a portfolio with substantial systematic risk (Beta of 1.2) and elevated risk resulting in a portfolio with a modest excess return and substantial volatility. As the *Long Short* portfolios are self-financing, the Excess Return on this portfolio is computed as the simple time series of average of returns on the porfolio, whereas the Excess Returns for *In Zone*, *Market* and *Out of Zone* are computed as the time series of average of the returns on the portfolio less the returns on the Fama French’s risk free assset.

Next we will look at the performance of the portfolios of the large bucket over multiple time periods. First thing to note is that the *Market portfolio* has betas that are close to 1 and relatively small alphas. We would expect this as the firms in the large bucket (one-third of the firms by count) will caputure the vast majority of the market capitalization of the market as a whole. Further, the 49.6 Sharpe Ratio and excess return of 7.3% for the time period 1976-2017 are very close to the Sharpe Ratio and Excess Returns reported for the market in Buffett’s Alpha for the same time period. If we compare the performance of the *Out of Zone* to *Market* it has lower excess returns in all but the full time period and substantially lower Sharpe Ratios and negative alphas. Conversely, the *In Zone* portfolio always has higher excess returns, alphas and Sharpe Ratio. Once again, we see the that the long short portfolio performs poorly with only modest excess returns and Sharpe Ratios. The Sharpe Ratio of the *In Zone* portfolio of 0.552 during the time period 1976-2017, which compares to the 0.79 reported in Buffett’s Alpha for Berkshire Hathaway, which implies that Berkshire’s stock selection process adds value above and beyond choosing large stocks at random that are *In Zone*.

Next we look at the performance of the medium sized firms over multiple time periods. *In the Zone* consistently outperforms the market by about 100bps in Excess returns and has better Sharpe Ratios and Alpha. Conversely, the *Out of Zone* portfolio under performs – by more than 200 bps in excess returns and has lower Sharpe Ratios, Information Ratios and Alphas. For the 1976-2017 time period, the *In Zone* portfolio has a Sharpe Ratio in excess of 0.624, and 0.615 for the post 2000 time period.

# What factors do they load on?

Following the performance attribution framework in Buffett’s Alpha, for each portfolio we will regress the excess returns onto the factors *The Market* (MKT)), *Small minus Big* (SMB), *High Book to Equity minus Low* (HML), *Up minus Down* (UMD), *Betting Against Beta* (BAB), *Quality minus Junk* (QMJ). As each factor exhibits positive excess returns over a long period of time a portfolio that loads positively on one or more of the factors will typically have strong performance. We report the coefficients from such regressions along with the Rsqu of the regression in the table below. We see that all but the long short portfolios load heavily on the MKT and on SMB. The *out of zone* load negatively on both QMJ (strongly) and HML (less strongly). The *In the Zone* loads positively on the BAB and the HML factor. The alpha on *In Zone* is small and insignificant, while the alpha on \_)*Out of Zone* is positive. This would indicate that the performance differences are largely determined by the factor loadings -– *In Zone* outperforms because it loads positively on BAB, HML and QMJ relatively to the Market, and *out of zone* performs poorly because it loads negatively on HML and QMJ relative to the market.

Given the heavy weighting on the SMB factor implicit in how all the portfolios are constructred, we next do a performance attribution for each size group. Not surprisingly, SMB continues to be an important factor for the Small group portfolios (except for th long short portfolio) and not for the Big group portfolios. *In Zone* loads positively on the BAB and QMJ for the Big and Medium size groups, and is “less negative” than the loadings in *Market* portfolio for the Small group. The loading on QMJ is very negative for the *Out of Zone* portfolio for the Small and Mid size groups

# What Performance Can We Expect Going Forward?

We can estimate a “Expected Excess Returns” “Expected Sharpe Ratios” and “Expected Information Ratios” for each portfolio by assuing tha the following assumptions:

1)  the factoring loadings are persistent
2)  the ‘alpha’ of each porfolio of 0 after controlling for the factor loadings
3)  The mean returns exhibited of each factor over the past sixy years will persist
4)  The variance covariance matrix of each factor will persist.

The table below presents the results from this analysis. In all cases, the Expected Sharpe Ratio of the *Out of Zone* portfolio is significantly below that of the market. And in all cases the Expected Sharpe Ratio of the *In the Zone* portfolio out performs the market. The Excess Returns of *In the Zone* exceed more than 100bps. In factor the Expected Sharpe Ratio for the *In Zone* Big portfolio reaches 52.3 and 54.2 for the Mid size portfolio.
