This note verifies the approach taken on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) in _Valuation Space_ by first replicating the approach taken by Damodaran and then comparing it with the approach in _Valuation Space_. Buying and holding NVDA is an act of accepting ordinary stock returns for the extraordinary performance of NVDA as a company.  This statement holds for a trillion-dollar valuation (as was observed at the end of Q2 2023) and as well as for a valuation of \$329B.
